# UE_InactivitTime_Study
* In this ad-hoc study, roughly half-million records of device activities were analyzed to gain insight into the statistical characteristics and distribution of "idle time" and "connection/session duration" of mobile phones, in general throughout the day

* The objective was mainly to come up with a data-driven decision on how to set the "user inactivity timer" on the network side which have major implications on the volume of control messages exchanged with the core, spectrum efficiency, phone power consumption and other KPIs
